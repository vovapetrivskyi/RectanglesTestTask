# RectanglesTestTask

Implement a web api that would:
- Accept two pairs of doubles, representing a segment
- Search internal database and return a list of rectangles that interset the input segment by any of the edges
- Any ORM or raw SQL of a preference
- Storage format/schema can be of any preference
- Consider performance implications for large number of stored rectangles
- Unit/integration tests is a plus
- Github repository
